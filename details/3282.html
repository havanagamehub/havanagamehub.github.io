    <div class="opacity description">Take the wheel of a flying car and don't be late for a second term at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry&#228; in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&#228;! Based on J.K. Rowling's second book in the worldwide best-selling series, players face a magical multitude of new challenges and mysteries as the famous "Boy Who Lived".<br><br> Ignoring Dobby&#228; the house-elf's grave warning that disaster will strike if he returns to Hogwarts, Harry embarks on his second year to find Dobby's predictions coming true! Harry soon finds himself entangled in a dark plot against his "Mudblood" classmates, as students keep turning up petrified! Could Draco Malfoy&#228; be to blame, or is something even more malevolent at work? With the help of returning friends Hermione, Ron, Hagrid&#228; and Hedwig&#228;, players attend new classes to learn second-year spells that will aid them in a quest to uncover the true identity of the "Heir of Slytherin".<br><br> Players enter fantastical free-roaming 3D environments from Harry's world. Players become Harry Potter&#228; and delve not only into Harry's world, but also into his personality, via an internal "voice." Conversing with unique characters like Moaning Myrtle&#228;, shopping in Diagon Alley&#228;, and exploring the convoluted corridors of Hogwarts, players make crucial and independent decisions within Harry's world. <br><br> Additionally, Harry can, of course, cast spells against foes - but these spells must be perfectly executed, or they could be miscast with humorous or critical consequences! Mini-games within levels can be revisited, so players can help Mrs. Weasley with "de-gnoming" her garden, challenge other students in Professor Lockhart's Dueling Club, or complete other mini-games again and again. <br><br> <ul> <li>Freely explore the captivating environments based on Hogwarts and its grounds with more control and character interaction. </li> <li>Encounter thrilling moments from the book such as the Whomping Willow&#228;, the Dueling Club and a confrontation in the Chamber of Secrets! </li> <li>Attend 2nd year classes, and learn advanced spells, with direct spell casting control using a "Flick and Swish" movement on the next generation consoles. Face-off against fantastic creatures like Aragog&#8482; the spider and the terrible basilisk. </li> <li>Engage in a second season of Quidditch, but with a rogue Bludger on the loose! </li> <li>Interact with old friends like Hermione and Ron and new faces like Moaning Myrtle and pompous Professor Lockhart&#8482;. </li> <li>Uncover special items and secret areas including Tom Riddle's&#228; diary and the sinister Chamber of Secrets. </li> <li>Voyage to enchanting locations for exotic excursions: help the Weasley's "de-gnome" the Burrow, venture to Diagon</li> <li>Alley for 2nd year Hogwarts supplies, and go farther than ever into the Forbidden Forest. </li> <li>Faithful representation of the magical world created in J.K. Rowling's best-selling novel. </li> </ul></div>
