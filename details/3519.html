Players can travel the rich vastness of the Gemini star system freely, fight skirmishes with rogue ships, trade commodities, research anomalies, buy new vessels, upgrade their ships with state-of-the-art technology, increase their experience and rank to become more powerful and ultimately use all that in large scale engagements against other fleets of hostile ships.<br /><br /> Players re-emerge into the star system of Gemini after having been trapped in the so-called Stasis rift anomaly for over twenty years.
