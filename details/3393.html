    <div class="opacity description"><b>Need for Speed&amp;#153;, one of the world's bestselling video game franchises, returns with a vengeance in the new action-driving blockbuster Need for Speed Payback.</b> <br/><br/> Set in the underworld of Fortune Valley, you and your crew are reunited by a search for vengeance against The House, a nefarious cartel that rules the city's casinos, criminals, and cops. In this corrupt gambler's paradise, the stakes are high and The House always wins. Play a variety of challenges and events as Tyler, the Racer; Mac, the Showman; and Jess, the Wheelman. Each driver must take on races, missions, and challenges to earn the respect of the Valley's underground and compete in the ultimate race to finally take down The House. <br/><br/> Your car is at the centre of everything you do. Craft unique rides with deeper performance and visual customization than ever before. Push them to the limit when you narrowly escape the heat in epic police chases. Go head-to-head with other racers on- or off-road through canyons, deserts, mountains, and the city. Raise the stakes by putting down additional in-game currency on events, challenges and missions to multiply your winnings, or risk losing it all. For ultimate bragging rights, connect via Autolog recommendations and compete with your friends and ... for the first time ... with potential rivals. Your leaderboard will populate with other players of similar skill level so you can see how you rank around the world. <br/><br/> From insane heist missions to devastating car battles to jaw dropping set piece moments, Need for Speed&amp;#153; Payback delivers an edge-of-your-seat, action-driving fantasy. <br/><br/> <b>KEY FEATURES<br/> Scrap to Stock to Supercar:</b> Endlessly fine-tune your performance through each of the five distinct car classes (Race, Drift, Off-Road, Drag, and Runner), to turn the tables on the competition in any race, mission, or challenge. Find abandoned vehicles scattered throughout the world to build your perfect car from the ground up. Collect, win, or buy the hottest after-market parts and craft a fleet of perfect driving machines. <br/><br/> <b>Live out an action-driving fantasy:</b> Play through an explosive adventure as three distinct playable characters united by a common goal: revenge at any cost. Tyler, Mac, and Jess team up to even the score, and enter the ultimate race to take down The House. Battle cops with ever-increasing intensity, race against rivals across the city, and drive on- and off-road through mountains, canyons, and desert. <br/><br/> <b>High-stakes competition:</b> Get on a roll and win big with risk-versus-reward gameplay. The return of intense cop chases means the stakes have never been higher. Put your reputation on the line and challenge your friends or potential rivals via Autolog recommendations throughout the campaign events or go head-to-head in classic online leaderboards. <br/><br/></div>
