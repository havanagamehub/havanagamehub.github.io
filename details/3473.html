    <div class="opacity description">TEST YOUR SKILLS, FEEL THE THRILLS, REACH THE LIMITS. <br/><br/> AND THEN, GO BEYOND. <br/><br/> TAKE RACES TO THE NEXT LEVEL OF REALISM! <br/><br/> Your desire to race deserves the best motorbikes. For the first time ever, the new chapter of the RIDE franchise was made exclusively for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and PC, bringing to the game a new, stunning level of realism and lifelike experiences! <br/><br/> <b>Key Features:</b> <ul> <li><b>THE SKY'S THE LIMIT</b><br/> Actually, we went even beyond. The incredible attention to detail doesn't stop at the perfection of faithful reproductions, the way the bikes behave during the race, or the breath-taking views. Even the sky itself is now a celebration of realism, thanks to the Dynamic Weather system and new volumetric clouds, which will now change shape and density, interacting with the lighting and ever-changing weather conditions. Graphics, animations, environments, technical details: everything contributes to make it feel like you're really there.</li><br/> <li><b>WHERE THERE'S A WHEEL, THERE'S A WAY</b><br/> Enthusiasm might not be enough to win. But surely it is enough to learn how to achieve victory! We worked hard to nourish your enthusiasm and feed your passion for the 2-wheels, designing new tools to let you progressively learn and master the game.<br/> Regardless of your initial skill level, RIDE 5 will help you to unleash your full potential step by step, making learning a fun and rewarding experience. Adjust the new AI based riding aids to control brakes, cornering, steering, throttle and many more advanced settings to perfect your style and develop your skills!</li><br/> <li><b>PUT YOUR NAME ON THE MAP</b><br/> Looking for fame and success? It's gonna be a long way to the top, but the journey will be incredible! From local competitions to the most challenging races, you will test yourself on the most exciting tracks and face fiery rivals, ranked by their skill, guided by our advanced AI. Prove you are the best and climb the rankings to make your dreams of glory come true. Core and secondary events will also bring you more than just the joy of victory: depending on the difficulty of the event, you'll gain credits that can be used to upgrade and develop your bike and your outfit.</li><br/> <li><b>FUN COMES IN DIFFERENT FORMS</b><br/> Whether you are racing for fun or competing at a higher level, against yourself, time or your friends, no matter what you're looking for, RIDE 5 has the perfect game mode for you. Just like the most demanding races ever, the Endurance mode, where strategy and perseverance are as important as speed. With new in-race save and rewind features and online races available too! <br/><br/> Find opponents all around the globe and forget the limits: the cross-play between PS5 and Xbox Series and between PC users on Steam and Epic Games Store, and new dedicated online leaderboards will really put you on top of the world. And if you are up for a local challenge instead, double the fun with the duels in Split-screen mode to race your friends shoulder to shoulder.</li><br/> <li><b>THE GREATEST RIDE EVER</b><br/> The most desired motorcycles in the world are ready to hit the road. Get ready to enjoy the bikes you've always wanted and ride on the most stunning tracks all over the world, choosing among the widest range of real and original locations, always surrounded by breath-taking views. Feel the sense of freedom on your skin and let your passion run as fast as your speed.</li><br/> <li><b>STYLE RULES</b><br/> Even if you are into classic bikes, get yourself noticed with fresh and original looks!<br/> Make good use of our powerful graphic editors to create one of a kind liveries for your bike and outfits for your rider. Change colors, design, stickers on your suits and helmets and show off your creativity on the track! And then share your creations with the community, now even between different platforms.</li><br/> </ul></div>
