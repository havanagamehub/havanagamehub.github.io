    <div class="opacity description"><b>No Man's Sky is an epic science fiction adventure set across an infinite universe, in which every star is the light of a distant sun, each orbited by planets filled with life, and you can go to any of them you choose. In this infinite procedurally generated universe, you'll discover places and creatures that no other players have seen before - and perhaps never will again.</b> <br/><br/> A mystery lies at the centre of the galaxy, an irresistible pulse that draws you on an epic voyage to discover the true nature of the cosmos. Your journey will be charged with danger, encountering hostile creatures and fierce pirates, in order to survive you will need to prepare, upgrading your ship, suit and weapons. <br/><br/> Whether you choose to fight, trade or explore, every decision you make has consequences, shaping your journey as you travel ever deeper into No Man's Sky. <br/><br/> <b>Key Features:</b> <ul> <b><li>Now includes full multiplayer: </b> You'll be able to explore the universe with your friends, or bump into random travellers.

Fight as a pirate or a wingman in epic space battles with friends and enemies. Race exocraft across weird alien terrains, creating race tracks and trails to share online.</li><br/> <b><li>Embark on an epic voyage: </b> Learn the true nature of the cosmos.
